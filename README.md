## Kevin McCarthy

I worked at Amazon for 8 years before leaving to learn to code at Makers
Academy. 

Whilst at Amazon I learned a ton working my way from Customer Service Agent to
Team Lead and Team Manager before discovering my passion for helping others
learn first as a trainer and finally Instructional Designer (designing training curriculum).  

I also discovered Amazon was no longer the place for me and the bits I most enjoyed were
solving technical issues. I gave up my quite nice salary and all my lovely shares to go and learn to code at
Makers Academy.

Having made the decision it seemed an inevitable area to end up in, I had dipped in and out of coding from age of 9 on BBC Micro in BASIC, did work
experience in a webhouse in 1998 and did a bit of Java in college in 2001. 

I am really excited about learning, helping others
learn and the science of learning.  

I have a very loud laugh. Love being around passionate, highly-motivated people
who can make me laugh.
I like solving problems, building things and
bringing some joy to those around me.


## Skills

#### Proactive

I love seeking new ways of doing things and making consistent small
improvements.


During my time at Makers I consistently made pull requests to improve content
including considerable rewrites of exercise instructions. 



In my previous roles I pushed  
- Experience
- Achievements
- Evidence

#### Experimental
I greatly enjoy trying new things. 

I re-discovered development when I solved an issue we were having removing
non-relevant content from our training material prior to sending for
translation. By talking with localization engineer and learning myself about
macros I was able to set up a process which enabled us to accurately scope
localization effort (wordcount) and made it easy to mark content as being not
for translation. 

When developing our "Second Guessing" app none of us had used audio previously
and during our research stage I set up a sandbox to experiment with playing
audio on our front-end and how to 

I've recently purchased an Arduino starter kit and have greatly enjoyed playing
with this. I've successfully created the world's worst theremin and am planning
how to turn this into a Jean-Michel Jarre style keyboard. 


#### Innovation

  I enjoy coming up with and developing ideas.
  Whilst at Amazon I was shortlisted for the Big Ideas competition in my final two
  years. The ideas submitted were based on improving resources for
  Customer Service Agents to be able to improve customer satisfaction.

  I also introduced the concept of Designing for Localization during my time
with the ID team. 

  During my time at Makers we held open pitch sessions to decide what apps to
make as our final two projects. I had three of my app ideas chosen by the group
to turn into functioning
  products. I get an enormous sense of satisfaction from pitching ideas and seeing
  them come to fruition.

#### Managing Complex Projects
  As global Instructional Design (ID) Project Manager for new Fire tablet launch training, supported ID team in creation of global single source learning objects for 3000+ learners in 10 marketplaces including 7 languages.
  
  I came on to projects at an early stage building use cases,  

#### Determined
  Prior to starting Makers I had a fear of blogging and social media in general.
  In order to overcome this I wrote a blog every day during my time at Makers.

  While already employed as an Instructional Designer I self-funded my Masters
in ID to broaden my knowledge on the topic. I also attended a 6-part workshop
with Instructional Design guru Cathy Moore which was inspirational.
