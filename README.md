## Kevin McCarthy

A tremendously enthusiastic person, passionate about making and doing things that
improve people's lives. Gained a ton of experience in a variety of roles during my 8 years at Amazon
before giving up all the lovely shares to learn to make things with code at
Makers Academy. I'm looking for a challenging junior development position where
I can keep learning while adding value. Also fair warning, very loud laugh.


## Skills

#### Proactive

I love seeking new ways of doing things and making consistent small
improvements.

During my time at Makers I consistently made pull requests to improve content
including considerable rewrites of exercise instructions. 

In my previous roles I pushed  

#### Experimental
I greatly enjoy trying new things. 

I re-discovered development when I solved an issue we were having removing
non-relevant content from our training material prior to sending for
translation. By talking with localization engineer and learning myself about
macros I was able to set up a process which enabled us to accurately scope
localization effort (wordcount) and made it easy to mark content as being not
for translation. 

When developing our "Second Guessing" app none of us had used audio previously
and during our research stage I set up a sandbox to experiment with playing
audio on our front-end and how to set the time limits on the playing function. 

I've recently purchased an Arduino starter kit and have greatly enjoyed playing
with this. I've successfully created the world's worst theremin and am in
process of 
how to turn this into a Jean-Michel Jarre style keyboard.

#### Long Term Thinking
  I've been through the pain of doing things fast and then trying to scale.
Through first-hand experience I understand the importance of building things
that are extendable and reusable. Being able to weigh up short-term gains versus
long-term value. 

#### Innovation

  I enjoy coming up with and developing ideas.
  Whilst at Amazon I was shortlisted for the Big Ideas competition in my final two
  years. The ideas submitted were based on improving resources for
  Customer Service Agents to be able to improve customer satisfaction.

  During my time at Makers we held open pitch sessions to decide what apps to
make as our final two projects. I had three of my app ideas chosen by the group
to turn into functioning
  products. I get an enormous sense of satisfaction from pitching ideas and seeing
  them come to fruition.

#### Managing Complex Projects
  As global Instructional Design (ID) Project Manager for new Fire tablet launch training, supported ID team in creation of global single source learning objects for 3000+ learners in 10 marketplaces including 7 languages.
  
  I came on to projects at an early stage building use cases generally about 2-3
months before products were launched when there still was not set final feature
set. Assigning resources ahead of time with the knowledge that all timeframes
could change, feature sets could change and   

#### Determined
  Prior to starting Makers I had a fear of blogging and social media in general.
  In order to overcome this I wrote a blog every day during my time at Makers.

  While already employed as an Instructional Designer I self-funded my Masters
in ID to broaden my knowledge on the topic. I also attended a 6-part workshop
with Instructional Design guru Cathy Moore which was inspirational. 

#### Customer Obsession
  While at Amazon I learned a lot about truly valuing your customers. Every
decision made was built around the customer experience. This was not just about
end users but also treating stakeholders as customers. Delighting your
customers was always the goal and by giving them what they need, not necessarily what they want is
something I've become adept at.
